# Survival-Boost
This is the first game I ever made. Technically it's more of a tech demo, but this game was made with Unity Engine.

It's a 2.5D platformer where the goal is to get your ship from one platform to the other. Your ship can only move up or down and rotate itself clockwise and counterclockwise to reach the end platform.

I learned how to make this game through Udemy's Complete C# Unity Developer 3D course. All assets and core gameplay are from this course, as well as the code to make the gameplay elements. However, I improved and refactored some of the code based upon my prior knowledge with programming in C#.

To find the source code for this project, go to Assets->Scripts. I also created a UML class diagram for the project to show how I visualized the scripts behaving with one another. The link provided is the progress I have made so far.

Currently working on getting the game hosted on GitHub, but as of now it is not working.
