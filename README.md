# Survival-Boost
This is the first game I ever made. Technically it's more of a tech demo, but this game was made with Unity Engine v2019.4.3f1.

It's a 2.5D platformer where the goal is to get your ship from one platform to the other. Your ship can only move up or down and rotate itself clockwise and counterclockwise to reach the end platform.

I learned how to make this game through Udemy's Complete C# Unity Developer 3D course. All assets and core gameplay are from this course, as well as the code to make the gameplay elements. The codebase was initially from the course as well, however, I improved and refactored some of the code as Iâ€™ve gotten more experienced over time.

To find the source code for this project, go to Assets->Scripts. I also created a UML class diagram for the project to give a general overview of the codebase. The link provided is a glimpse of the first 5 levels so far.

Currently working on getting the game hosted on GitHub, but as of now it is not working. https://cjdasuperman.github.io/Survival-Boost/
